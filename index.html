          <h2> Apple Types</h2>
          <p>
            McIntosh: Classic large, round apple for eating out of hand! Ultra-juicy white flesh, lightly tart flavor and excellent fresh apple aroma. A perky addition to salads. Excellent in applesauce and cider. Also used in pies.
          <br>
            
          <br>
            Gala: Talk about a great apple. Crisp snappy bite over a mellow sweetness. Michigan’s 3rd most popular apple for fresh eating or cooking. Looks great, smells sweet, eats like a dream!
          <br>
            
          <br>
            Cortland: A hint of tartness makes this a great baking variety, used frequently in desserts. A descendant of the McIntosh, this variety is a bit sweeter than its ancestor. Known for its white flesh and excellent flavor.
          <br>
            
          <br>
            Jonathan: Both pretty and popular! Used for fresh eating and cooking. Juicy flavor has a spicy tang that blends well with other apples. Michigan’s cooler climate produces superb Jonathans. Discovered in Woodstock, New York!
          <br> 
            
          <br>
            Red Delicious: America’s most popular apple, known for the "five little bumps" on the bottom. Best for fresh eating and snacks. Full-flavored sweet taste, yellowish flesh and crisp texture. Discovered over 100 years ago in Iowa.
          <br> 
            
          <br>
            Golden Delicious: A gingery-smooth, sweet taste treat lies under a thin skin. The most popular yellow apple, Goldens may be eaten fresh or cut up in salads. Professional’s choice for applesauce or cider, baking pies and other desserts.
          <br>
            
          <br>
            Ida Red: Suits your every use! Eat fresh or for cooking. Taste is both tangy and tart. Flesh is white, crisp and juicy. Favored for sauces, pies and desserts. Texture holds up well when baked.
          <br>
            
          <br>
            Northern Spy: Intriguing name, yet this apple is a professional baker’s dream! An antique apple still popular because of tart, acidic properties that cook up well in applesauce, pie and other dishes. A hard apple that ripens late and stores well.
          <br>
            
          <br>
            Fuji: New to Michigan’s apple line-up, Fuji is Japan’s favorite apple for good reason! Fantastic sweet and tart flavor, with a low acid content. An incredibly good keeper, Fuji stays crisp for weeks!
          <br>
            
          <br>
            Golden Russett: The Golden Russet is usually considered as one of the best-flavored of the American russet apples. It's great for making cider or eating fresh!
